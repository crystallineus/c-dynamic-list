# DynamicList in C++

A simple dynamic array implementation in C++ using raw pointers.  
This project is a great way to learn how memory works, including how to use `new`, `delete`, and how dynamic resizing works â€” just like a baby version of `std::vector`.

## What You'll Learn

- How to use pointers in C++
- Dynamic memory allocation with `new[]` and `delete[]`
- How to manage capacity and resizing arrays
- Constructors and destructors
- The basics of building your own data structures

## How It Works

The `DynamicList` class supports:

- Adding integers with `add(int)`
- Automatically resizing when the array is full
- Printing the current list

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo or copy the files

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamiclist-cpp.git
cd dynamiclist-cpp
```

### 2. Compile and run

```bash
g++ -o list DynamicList.cpp
./list
```

### 3. Output

```bash
[ 10 20 30 40 50 ]
```
